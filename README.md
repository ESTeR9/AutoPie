# AutoPie

AutoPie is a simple, yet powerful command line application which helps in organizing files, easily and effectively. Using this tool, you can save a lot of time. This application works on a Windows PC.

What this application does in particular is moving all the files with a user given file extension from a given source folder to a given destination folder. The destination folder must exist.

My motto is to automate boring stuff.

# AutoPie
AutoPie is a simple, yet powerful command line application which helps in organizing files, easily and effectively. Using this tool, you can save a lot of time. My motto is to automate the boring stuff. This application works on a Windows PC.

What this application does in particular is moving all the files with a user given file extension from a given source folder to a given destination folder. If the destination folder does not exist, it creates a new one.

This app is at the most basic form and is under expansion and improvement.

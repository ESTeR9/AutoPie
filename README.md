# AutoPie

AutoPie is a simple, yet powerful command line application which helps in organizing files, easily and effectively. Using this tool, you can save a lot of time. This application works on a Windows PC.

What this application does in particular is moving all the files with a user given file extension from a given source folder to a given destination folder. If the destination folder must exist.

This app is at the most basic form and is under expansion and improvement.

You can download this application as a single executable file from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZsXQORrY2-TG_K0dT4T6fpv35gNfgtKD).

My motto is to automate boring stuff.
